# bruteforce_application

This script represents a simple application for brute force wrote with Python to target an ssh server. It uses a library known 
for network automation it is 'Paramiko' to establish the connection to the destination and then to check the right username and password.

When the pair is found, the application stop running and return with right ones.

I put with this script two simple files to use for usernames and passwords and they represent our dictionaries to make a small test for the application. 

In the real case please choose longer dictionaries.
